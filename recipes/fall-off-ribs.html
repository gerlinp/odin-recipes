      <li><strong>Dry Rub:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp. Cumin</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp. Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp. Paprika</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp. Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp Ground Mustard</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp. Garlic Powder</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by preheating your oven or grill to 300°F (150°C), setting the stage for a slow and
        delectable cooking process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean the rack of pork ribs, and use a paper towel to pat them dry, ensuring the dry rub
        adheres perfectly.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a small knife, carefully remove any excess fat from the ribs. Locate the membrane on
        the back of the ribs, make a small cut at the corner, and peel the membrane back using a
        paper towel for a better grip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously coat the ribs with the delightful dry rub, infusing them with a symphony of
        flavors. Place the ribs meat side down in a large baking pan and tightly cover the pan with
        foil, ensuring the shiny side is facing out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill or bake the ribs in the preheated oven for 2½ to 3 hours, allowing the slow and gentle
        heat to work its magic. If using a grill, opt for indirect heat to ensure even cooking and
        avoid any risk of charring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once done, remove the ribs from the heat and carefully remove the foil, anticipating some
        flavorful liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush both sides of the ribs with your preferred amount of BBQ sauce, enhancing the richness
        of the ribs with every glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        For an irresistible finishing touch, caramelize the BBQ sauce. Grill the ribs for about 5
        minutes on each side, basting them with additional BBQ sauce. If using an oven, you can
        achieve the same effect by setting it to broil or using high heat and watching closely to
        avoid burning.
      </li>
    </ol>
