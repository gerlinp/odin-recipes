    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>10-12 chicken wings</li>
      <li>Melted Unsalted Butter</li>
      <li>Lemon Pepper seasoning</li>
      <li>Enough Vegetable Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat both oven and deep fryer to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>
        Pat the chicken wings with a paper towel to make them as dry as possible. Add a pinch of
        black pepper on the wings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the all-purpose flour, chili powder, 1 tsp of pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in
        a small bowl. Lightly coat the chicken wings with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the coated wings for about 10 - 15 minutes or until they turn golden brown. Remove the
        wings and place them on a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the melted unsalted butter with lemon pepper seasoning, and using a brush, coat the
        wings with the mixture evenly on all sides. Immediately put the wings into the preheated
        oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the wings for 5 minutes in the oven, and as soon as they are out, sprinkle a small
        amount of salt on them while they are still hot.
      </li>
