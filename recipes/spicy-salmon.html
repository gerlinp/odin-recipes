    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A mouthwatering dish that perfectly balances sweet and savory flavors. With just the right

      fillet to a whole new level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 oz salmon fillet</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Gochujang</li>
      <li>1-2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>Cooked white rice as a side dish</li>
      <li>Green onions or scallions, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pre-heat your oven to broil, setting the stage for creating a perfectly glazed salmon.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the Gochujang, crushed garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and a
        pinch of salt, creating a rich and flavorful glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare your baking sheet by covering it with tin foil. Lay the salmon fillet on the foil
        and generously coat all sides with the tantalizing Gochujang glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place the glazed salmon on the top oven rack, positioning it as close to the coils
        as possible for that delectable broiled finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a few minutes under the broiler, your salmon will be beautifully caramelized and
        cooked to perfection. Garnish with fresh green onions or scallions to add a burst of color
        and extra flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve this tantalizing Spicy Gochujang Glazed Salmon alongside fluffy white rice, allowing
        the two to complement each other in every mouthful. Don't hesitate to drizzle extra sauce
        over the rice for an extra kick of spicy goodness.
      </li>
    </ol>
